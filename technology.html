    <p>In the fashion industry there has a been a rise in the use of 3D printing because of how much it grants us to create new designs with different shapes and sizes, as well as the never ending innovations in technology and the fact that it reduces waste and it is way more sustainable because it’s made as one of a kind for a client. </p>

        <h2>IRIS VAN HERPEN</h2>
        <p class="intro">Dutch designer Iris van Herpen is one of the most notable fashion designers nowadays because of her unique and innovative techniques that she applies in her designs. She uses her knowledge on science and technology, art and architecture and other more areas in order to create futuristic pieces for runways. She uses many technological techniques for her designs, for instance 3D printing, molding from clay and laser cutting. Hence, this hybrid type of haute couture fashion differs from other big fashion brands that focus more on what is trending, rather than what could be revolutionary. </p>

            <li class="voltage">
                <p class="volt">his design is from the earlier collections, the 2013 “Voltage” collection. The collection explores the use of electricity in our bodies. This gown is made out of 3d printed flexible materials. The white spikes are made out of Laser-cut 3-D polyester film lace and the black dress underneath it is made from microfiber.  Microfiber is a softer material, meaning that despite that this dress looks uncomfortable, it isn’t. This is an achromatic look, considering the black heels as well. It looks like the dress has been electroshocked due to the white spikes that have an outward geometric look.</p>

        <li class="magneticdress">
            <p class="dress">This is the “Magnetic motion dress” from the “Magnetic motion” collection from 2015. The theme behind it is the interplay of the magnetic forces. This dress is made of
                3-D-printed transparent photopolymer and stereolithography resin. Resin is just an unprocessed plastic, so this crystalline looking design is actually made out of plastic but by 3D printing. The designer admitted that she used this materials because of how much they allow details to be formed, as well as fragile refinery while also creating a somewhat   transparent design.  The 3D printing provides the difference in size and texture for all of the little segments this dress is made out of. For the construction of this dress, ultraviolet light was focused on the surface of a liquid polymer as the layers harden by the light. This design looks like it was made out of ice, rather than plastic polyesters, thanks to 3D printing. Looking at it from further away it looks rather white, resembling ice, as ice has these characteristics, however it is semi-translucent because it allows small amount of light to pass through it.

        <h2>NERI OXMAN - WANDERERS</h2>
    <p class="neriintro">One of the known artist that has an obvious similarity in her work is artist, architect and a MIT professor, Neri Oxman. She specializes in merging computational design with scientific materials. She has done one fashion exhibition named “Wanderers” where she uses 3D printing to create the designs but with biologically engineered living microorganisms. </p>

   </ul>
        <p class="mushtari">This design was named ”Mushtari” from the “Wanderer” collection. The inspiration behind it was to create a design for extreme conditions and this one on particular is for Jupiter. The inspiration is the gastrointestinal tract, hence it was produced to replicate some of the processes that the human body does. Briefly explained, it contains synthetic microorganisms that are able to do various things, like changing colors and producing sugar and food for the microorganisms.  It is made by 3D printing and usage of synthetic biology, computational design and additive manufacturing.  </p>

    <p class="explanation">Japanese fashion brand Anrealage has presented a colour-changing collection at Paris Fashion Week that was activated by suspended moving UV lights. This colour-changing technique was achieved by constructing garments using photochromic fabrics and materials that change colour when exposed to sunlight and proximity of UV rays. After around three minutes, the garments returned to their original colour, once the photochromatic areas were no longer exposed to UV rays.</p>
